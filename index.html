    <h1>LOOSE SKETCHING</h1>
        <img src="loose_sketch.jpg" alt="Loose Sketch">
        <p class="first-sec">Loose sketching is a relaxed and comfortable drawing style that focuses on capturing the essence
        of a subject rather than its details. Loose drawings can be accurate while retaining a sense of freshness and humanity.
        Drawing or sketching loosely means drawing in a more relaxed and comfortable style, which in itself shows confidence in
        the drawing. The idea of sketching loosely is to not worry about the details but to capture the “bigger picture” and the 
        essence of your subject. Loose sketch or drawing looks natural and effortless. In my opinion, a looser sketch can capture the atmosphere at the 
        time of the sketch, and I think this is an important quality for urban sketchers to learn as urban sketching is all about 
        capturing the things you see in the world, right in front of you at that moment in time.You may prefer tight lines and details in your sketches 
        but I do encourage you to take some time to at least try out loosening up…you may just find it unlocks some further creativity within you. If 
        anything though, it will certainly help you to sketch more quickly, which is a valuable skill to have when you are trying to capture an ever-changing scene.</p><br><hr><hr>

    <h1>ACRYLIC PAINTING</h1>
        <img src="acrylic.jpeg" alt="Acrylic Painting">
        <p class="second-sec">Acrylic paint is a type of paint that is mixed with a water-soluble resin. They are typically used to create a layer of paint on a surface.
             Acrylic paint is typically made from acrylic resin, pigment, and dyes.This type of paint is typically used to create a layer of paint on a surface. The paints
            have high resistance to solvents and are formulated for indoor and outdoor applications. The paints are typically used for a range of applications
             like posters, signs, signs and decorations, and home decoration.
             Acrylic painting is one of the most popular types of painting today. It can be done at home, unlike oil painting, and it is a quick, cheap, and easy way to 
             create fine art. It is also a unique type of art, as it is not a traditional form of painting, in that it doesn’t use paint. Instead, acrylic painting is 
             done using acrylic paint and water. Because of this, acrylic paintings are generally waterproof and can be hung on the wall almost immediately after being created.
             In art, there are two basic methods of painting: acrylic painting and ink painting. Both techniques are extremely popular in the modern art world, and both 
             techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><br><hr><hr>

    <h1 class="h3">SKETCHING</h1>
        <img src="sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch">
        <p class="third-sec">Sketch, traditionally a rough drawing or painting in which an artist notes down his preliminary ideas for a work that will eventually be realized
             with greater precision and detail. The term also applies to brief creative pieces that per se may have artistic merit.
             In a traditional sketch, the emphasis usually is laid on the general design and composition of the work and on overall feeling. Such a sketch is often intended for the 
             artist’s own guidance; but sometimes, in the context of a bottega (studio-shop) type of production, in which an artist would employ many assistants, sketches were made
             by the master for works to be completed by others. There are three main types of functional sketches. The first—sometimes known as a croquis—is intended to remind the 
             artist of some scene or event he has seen and wishes to record in a more permanent form. The second—a pochade—is one in which he records, usually in colour, the 
             atmospheric effects and general impressions of a landscape. The third type is related to portraiture and notes the look on a face, the turn of a head, or other physical
             characteristics of a prospective sitter.</p>
